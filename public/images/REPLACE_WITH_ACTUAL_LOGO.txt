REMINDER: 

Please replace the logo.png file in this directory with your actual logo image.

The logo is used in the following locations:
1. Navbar (top navigation)
2. Footer

The current implementation expects an image file named "logo.png" in the public/images/ directory.

For best results, use a transparent PNG file with dimensions around 150px width Ã— 40px height.
